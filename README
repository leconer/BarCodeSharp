This project is a fork of The Zebra Crossing CSharp port. 
The purpose of the project is to recognize bar codes from C# and other .NET projects.

GET STARTED

To get started, download the source code, and add the project to your solution.

The fastest way to get a short understanding of how to use the project is to look at the tests in the zxing.Tests folder.

For example you can re-use this helper method:

public Result RecognizeBarCode(Bitmap bmp, ArrayList formats, Boolean pureBarCode = false, Boolean tryHarder = false)
{
    Reader reader = new MultiFormatReader();

    var source = new RGBLuminanceSource(bmp, bmp.Width, bmp.Height);
    Binarizer binarizer = new HybridBinarizer(source);
    Hashtable table = new Hashtable();
    table.Add(DecodeHintType.PURE_BARCODE, pureBarCode);
    table.Add(DecodeHintType.TRY_HARDER, tryHarder);
    table.Add(DecodeHintType.POSSIBLE_FORMATS, formats);
    BinaryBitmap binBmp = new BinaryBitmap(binarizer);

    Result result = reader.decode(binBmp, table);
    return result;
}

To use the helper method for recognizing a Code128 encoded bar code, use this method:

var bmp = new Bitmap("MyBarcodeImage.jpg");
var formats = new ArrayList() { BarcodeFormat.CODE_128 };
var result = RecognizeBarCode(bmp, formats);
Console.WriteLine(result.Text);

If you are having trouble recognizing the barcode, you can either:

1. Try out different encodings by adding them to the ArrayList, e.g. new ArrayList() { BarcodeFormat.CODE_128, BarcodeFormat.CODE_39 };
2. Enable the TryHarder flag, e.g. RecognizeBarCode(bmp, new ArrayList() { BarcodeFormat.CODE_128 }, false, true);

Please note that the project currently requires you to allow unsafe code. This is not important to me,
but I realize that it might be to others, so I'm working on removing this constraint.


---- IMPORTANT NOTE ----
THE CURRENT CODE IS NOT STABLE!!
IT HAS BEEN TESTED MOSTLY FOR CODE39 AND CODE128 ENCODED BAR CODES.

IF YOU RECEIVE MYSTERIOUS EXCEPTIONS, PLEASE CREATE AN ISSUE HERE ON GITHUB 
WITH A LINK TO A DOWNLOADABLE IMAGE WITH YOUR BARCODE, 
SO I CAN REPRODUCE THE BUG. 

I will gladly help you, so that we can stabilize the code together:-)
